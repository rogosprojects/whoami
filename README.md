# Whoami

Whoami is an app developed to demo the capabilities of Kubernetes. It provides
endpoints to stress-test and get information on the running system.

## Available Endpoints

- `/`: the app's landing page only shows the hostname, the list of network
  interfaces and their IP address and the HTTP request that generated the
  response. See [Environment](#Environment) for how to slightly tweak this
  page.
- `/cpustress`: shows an overview of the CPU usage. You can also send all the
  CPU threads to maximum load for a chosen amount of time.
- `/memstress`: shows an overview of the memory usage. You can also pick a time
  interval during which the application will continuously perform bite-sized
  allocations until completely running out of memory (if you picked a high
  enough interval, otherwise the allocations will stop but the memory won't be
  reclaimed by the OS until the next run of the garbage collector).
- `/metrics`: useful metrics on the Go runtime, provided by
  [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
- `/readiness` and `/healthz`: produce a JSON report on the current status of
  the container. Orchestrators such as Kubernetes can use the HTTP status code
  returned by these endpoints to manage containers autonomously.
- `/zee`, `/captainkube`, `/phippy`, `/goldie`: some cute pictures followed by
  the system info (as in `/`).
- `/env`: show all OS environment variables

## Environment
- `LOG_INTERVAL`: controls how often the app logs CPU and memory usage to the
  console\* (example: `10s` for 10 seconds). A non-positive value disables
  logging entirely;
- `READINESS_DELAY`: controls how long it'll take for the app to report itself
  as ready to handle new incoming requests (15 seconds by default)\* (example:
  `1m` for one minute);
- `HEALTH_DELAY`: controls how long it'll take for the app to report a healthy
  status\* (example: `20s` for seconds);
- `NAME_APPLICATION`: you can optionally show an image in the landing page as
  per by `/goldie`, `/zee`, `/captainkube`, `/phippy`.  Possible values:
  `goldie`, `zee`, `captainkube`, `phippy`.

> (*) The value of those variables is fed to
> [time.ParseDuration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) so any value
> accepted by that function is also accepted by those environment variables.
